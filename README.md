## How do boids work?
Boids are simple position vectors that follow 3 rules:
1. Alignment
2. Separation
3. Cohesion

All of these rules applies varying forces on each boid that accelerates each position vector to reach a maximum velocity.
More information on boids and their applications can be found [here](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)
